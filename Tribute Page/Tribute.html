     <p id="tribute-info"> Through the ages, man has called dog one of his closest companions. He has also called him protector, helper, lifesaver, and provider. Dogs are an incredible friend to man because they have been there through the years, through any task and any challenge,
       but the relationship between dog and man goes a bit deeper (and older). The friendship between dog and man dates back to 15,000 years when dogs, who originated from a common ancestor, followed man throughout his migrations in East Asia. Psychologically, this connection makes sense because both man and dog are social beings.
       Neither can thrive when alone, and both benefit mentally (and often physically) from such a strong bond. Having a dog at home gives us a listening ear and a warm paw to hold. </p>

       10 facts about dogs
     </h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Much like fingerprints on humans, the ridges on dogs’ noses form single patterns that set them aside from any other dog.</li>
       <li>The nose of our canine companions has as many as 300 million receptors that help them detect tiny concentrations of odor. </li>
       <li>Dogs actually kick backwards after doing their toilet business as a way to mark their territory using the scent glands in their paws.</li>
       <li>Dogs are not much of chewers if they can simply swallow the food Dogs’ saliva doesn’t contain any digestive enzymes, working as lubricant that helps food pass the esophagus easily into the stomach.</li>
       <li>Dog saliva contains chemicals with antibacterial properties, which help cleaning and promote the healing of superficial wounds.
         <li>Researchers say that our little buddies cannot feel any guilt, and the sad and eye-avoiding demeanor is nothing but an act set to match your rebuke!</li>
         <li>Spot that tongue. Spots on their tongue are not universal, but they are also not a cause for worryThey’re nothing more than simple deposits of pigment!</li>
         <li>Dogs lift their paws while urinating simply to spray their pee higher and in a more disseminated way, so other canines can easily smell it and know who runs the show in that territory.</li>
         <li>Dogs’ sweat glands are actually located around their foot pads! That’s why most of them will lay down when they’re hot, and why you might find tiny wet paw marks </li>
         <li>Dogs have a sort of “poop compass” embedded in them, and they try to find the right spot aligned with Earth’s magnetic field. </li>
